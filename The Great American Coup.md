I. THE REALITY WE'RE FACING
This isn't about politics. This isn't about Republican vs. Democrat. This is about documented violations of our Constitution happening right now, in real-time, with a clear pattern and intent.

Three Facts You Need to Understand

53%	Project 2025 Implemented in 13 months (Center for Progressive Reform, Feb. 2026)

10+	Impeachable offenses documented with legal citations

ACTIVE	Democratic safeguards systematically dismantled since January 20, 2025

This is not speculation.
This is documentation. Every claim in this document has a legal citation, a source link, or a court record. Verify it yourself.

II. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE COUP
What follows is not a list of policy disagreements. These are documented, sequenced steps with dates, legal citations, and verifiable evidence.

Phase 1: Eliminate Oversight (COMPLETE)
January 24, 2025 — Trump fired 17 Inspectors General in a single night, violating the Inspector General Act of 1978, which requires 30 days' written notice to Congress and a stated cause.
•	IGs are the internal watchdogs who expose corruption within agencies. Without them, there is no independent check on abuse of power.
•	Status: Successfully eliminated independent oversight across 17 federal agencies.

Phase 2: Criminalize Dissent (IN PROGRESS)
September 25, 2025 — NSPM-7 issued, designating 'anti-capitalism' and 'anti-Christianity' as domestic terrorism indicators.
•	Labor organizing → terrorism indicator
•	Environmental activism → terrorism indicator
•	Atheism → terrorism indicator
•	Progressive nonprofits → subject to IRS targeting
•	Antifa designated a terrorist organization via executive order — despite being an ideology, not an organization, meaning the label can be applied to anyone.
•	October 8, 2025: White House roundtable with Stephen Miller 'leading the hunt' for domestic opposition.
•	Status: Legal framework now in place to prosecute political opposition as terrorism.

Phase 3: Deploy Military Force Domestically (ACTIVE)
•	Documented federal deployments: Portland, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington D.C.
•	Portland deployment blocked by federal judge as illegal.
•	October 8, 2025: Trump threatens Insurrection Act to override court orders blocking National Guard deployments.
•	The Posse Comitatus Act (1878) prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement. The Insurrection Act has not been invoked without state consent in over 60 years.
•	Status: Active deployments ongoing. Courts blocking some. Administration threatening to override the courts.

Phase 4: Target Opposition Leaders (CURRENT)
•	October 8, 2025 Roundtable: Administration officials repeatedly named Democratic governors and state officials, calling them 'criminals who need to be jailed.'
•	Language documented: 'under investigation,' 'criminals,' 'need to be jailed,' and Miller is 'leading the hunt.'
•	Financial warfare: $8 billion cancelled to 16 states — all with two Democratic senators.
•	$18 billion in infrastructure funding frozen for New York City.
•	Federal funding weaponized as explicit political punishment.
•	Status: Building narrative justification for arresting elected officials.

Phase 5: Neutralize the Press (ESCALATING)
•	FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatened ABC with 'we can do this the easy way or the hard way' following Jimmy Kimmel criticism.
•	Masked federal agents physically attacked journalists in NYC — one hospitalized.
•	Federal agents attacked journalists documenting ICE operations in Chicago.
•	Jimmy Kimmel temporarily removed from air.
•	The First Amendment explicitly protects freedom of the press. Government officials threatening broadcasters and agents physically attacking journalists are hallmarks of authoritarian regimes.
•	Status: Physical violence against press escalating; threats against broadcast licenses active.

Every single one of these has legal citations, documented evidence, and constitutional or statutory basis.
This document does not ask you to trust any particular source. It asks you to check them yourself.

 
IV. THE ASSAULT ON VOTING RIGHTS
Beyond the direct constitutional violations above, a coordinated multi-front effort is underway to reshape who gets to vote in America. This is documented, it is active, and the timeline is urgent.

The SAVE America Act: A Modern Poll Tax
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act — now expanded and rebranded as the SAVE America Act — passed the House of Representatives on February 11, 2026 by a vote of 218-213. Every Republican voted yes. The only Democrat to cross over was Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas. It now moves to the Senate, where as of this writing it has secured 50 Republican votes — but needs 60 to overcome the filibuster. Senate Majority Leader Thune has confirmed there are 'not anywhere close' to the votes needed to eliminate the filibuster and force it through.

Important context:
Analysts note this bill may be designed to fail — so Trump and allies can claim 2026 midterm results are 'tainted' if it doesn't pass in time. The goal may be less about passing law than about delegitimizing future election outcomes.

What it does:
•	Requires every American to present documentary proof of citizenship — a passport or birth certificate — to register or update their voter registration.
•	Eliminates online voter registration and effectively ends mail-in registration.
•	Eliminates community voter registration drives.
•	Requires states to regularly submit voter rolls to the Department of Homeland Security.
•	Requires photo ID to vote in person and a scanned copy of ID for mail-in ballots.
•	Imposes civil AND criminal penalties on election officials who register an eligible citizen but fail to collect the correct paperwork — even if the voter is a genuine American citizen. Officials can be prosecuted for registering real citizens incorrectly.
•	Creates additional barriers for married women and LGBTQ+ Americans whose current legal name does not match their birth certificate.

Who it affects:
•	21.3 million Americans do not have ready access to a passport or birth certificate. (Brennan Center for Justice)
•	146 million Americans do not have a valid passport — compared to 153 million who voted in 2024.
•	69 million American women whose married name does not match their birth certificate face additional documentation hurdles.
•	LGBTQ+ Americans whose legal name has changed face the same mismatch problem.
•	In 7 states, fewer than 1 in 3 citizens have a valid passport: West Virginia, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma.
•	Only 1 in 5 Americans with income below $50,000 have a valid passport.
•	3.8 million adult U.S. citizens have no citizenship document at all. (UMD Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement)

The 24th Amendment Connection: A Modern Poll Tax
The 24th Amendment, ratified January 23, 1964, explicitly prohibits conditioning the right to vote on payment of any tax or fee. The Supreme Court extended this in Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections (1966) to any level of government, ruling that making wealth an electoral standard violates the Equal Protection Clause.

The SAVE Act imposes a financial barrier by a different name:
•	A U.S. passport costs $130.
•	A Certificate of Citizenship costs $1,385.
•	A birth certificate replacement costs money and time — more in some states.

Rep. Jennifer McClellan (D-VA) stated:
"Every document this bill demands costs money — and whether it's the $2.12 poll tax my father paid in 1947, a $130 passport or a $1,385 certificate of citizenship, even a cent is too much. The SAVE America Act is a modern-day poll tax."

Noncitizen voting — the stated justification for this legislation — is documented to be vanishingly rare:
•	Utah reviewed 2 million voter registrations (April 2025–January 2026): found 1 confirmed noncitizen registration and ZERO instances of noncitizen voting.
•	Only 0.04% of voter verification cases are returned as potential noncitizens by the DHS SAVE program.
•	Georgia's 8.4 million registered voters had just 20 noncitizens identified in a 2024 audit.
•	Kansas adopted documentary proof requirements and found 12% of eligible citizens — 31,000 people — were blocked from registering. Far more citizens blocked than noncitizens.

Trump's Elections Executive Order (March 25, 2025)
Unable to wait for Congress, Trump signed Executive Order 14248, 'Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,' which:
•	Directed the Election Assistance Commission — an independent bipartisan agency — to add proof-of-citizenship to the federal voter registration form.
•	Required federal agencies to withhold funding from states that don't comply.
•	Set Election Day as the national deadline for receiving mail ballots.
•	Granted DOGE access to check state voter rolls.

Courts have repeatedly blocked this order:
•	April 2025: Federal judge (D.C. District) issued preliminary injunction blocking proof-of-citizenship provision.
•	June 2025: Second injunction issued by Massachusetts judge blocking additional provisions, citing 'risk of irreparable harm' to voter registration.
•	October 31, 2025: Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly permanently blocked the citizenship requirement, writing: 'Our Constitution does not allow the President to impose unilateral changes to federal election procedures.'
•	February 2026: Another provision blocked — agencies cannot assess citizenship before distributing voter registration forms. Military personnel also protected.

The Administration's stated intent, on record:
On February 2, 2026, Trump said: 'The Republicans should say, We want to take over. We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many — 15 places.' White House Press Secretary confirmed he was referring to the SAVE Act. (Brookings Institution, February 2026)

 
V. THE PATTERN THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE

Reagan vs. Trump on Emergency Healthcare
Reagan (1986): Signed EMTALA — 'Every emergency room must treat and stabilize anyone in an emergency, regardless of ability to pay.'
Trump (2025): CMS rescinds guidance requiring emergency abortion care under EMTALA, effectively allowing states to prosecute hospitals for providing life-saving care.
The irony: A Republican president protected undocumented immigrants' emergency healthcare. Another Republican eliminated those protections and blamed Democrats.

Kristi Noem on National Guard Federalization
Noem (2020): 'If Joe Biden federalizes the National Guard, that would be a direct attack on states' rights.'
Noem (2025): Silent as Trump federalizes National Guard, deploys them illegally, and threatens the Insurrection Act.

Trump on Government Shutdowns
Trump (2013): 'When they talk about the government shutdown, they're going to be talking about the president of the United States... the pressure is on the president.'
Trump (2025): Has shut down government twice. Threatened to deny federal workers back pay, breaking a 2019 law he signed.

Project 2025: The Denial and the Reality
July 2024: Trump denied any knowledge of Project 2025 on the campaign trail.
January 2025 onward: His own officials wrote the document. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt — who called Trump's ties to Project 2025 nonexistent — is herself an instructor for Project 2025's 'Conservative Governance 101' training program.
•	Russell Vought, OMB Director: Co-author of Project 2025
•	Stephen Miller: Used America First Legal as bridge between Heritage Foundation and the Trump campaign
•	Brendan Carr, FCC Chair: Wrote the FCC chapter of Project 2025
•	Tom Homan, 'Border Czar': Project 2025 contributor

Current Status (February 2026):
The Center for Progressive Reform and Governing for Impact report 53% of Project 2025's domestic administrative agenda has been initiated or completed — 283 of 532 recommended actions. That is nearly 1 action per day since inauguration.

 
VI. WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT INFORMATION WARFARE
You're being played. We all are. Here's how.

The current environment rewards:
•	Speed over accuracy
•	Volume over consistency
•	Emotion over logic
•	Forgetting over documenting

They want you:
•	Angry (so you click, share, donate)
•	Tribal (so you ignore your own side's failures)
•	Exhausted (so you give up)
•	Confused (so you can't see the pattern)

The antidote is documentation. Not opinion. Not spin. Not outrage.
•	Exact quotes with timestamps
•	Legal citations with case names
•	Source links anyone can verify
•	Pattern recognition across time

VII. SPIRAL LOGIC: A METHOD FOR TRUTH
I've developed a debate methodology designed for exactly this environment. It's called Spiral Logic.
Full Framework: https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17Q8Vi8zSa/

Core principle: Use their own words and documented record to hold them accountable for their own contradictions.

Why it works:
•	Bad faith actors rely on you forgetting what they said yesterday
•	Spiral Logic documents everything with timestamps
•	When they contradict themselves, you show both statements side by side
•	They must either admit error or defend the contradiction on the record
•	Silence becomes documented defeat

Why bad actors won't use it:
•	Requires perfect consistency — impossible when lying
•	Creates permanent documentation that exposes past statements
•	One contradiction collapses the entire argument structure
•	High effort, zero yield for dishonest actors

Why truth-tellers should use it:
•	Reality is consistent — documentation protects it
•	The pattern becomes visible to observers over time
•	It scales through teaching others
•	It replaces outrage with evidence

VIII. THE HARD TRUTH ABOUT VIOLENCE
We need to be honest about what we're seeing. Both sides have incidents. How we respond depends entirely on whether it's politically convenient.

The Double Standard
When the attacker is from the left: 'Radical left terrorism!' Immediate condemnation, wall-to-wall coverage.
When the attacker is from the right: 'Mental health.' 'Lone wolf.' 'Let's not be divisive.'

This is not condemnation of one side. This is a call to apply the same standard to both.
The test nobody wants to take:
When you first heard about a political shooting, what was your first thought? 'I hope it wasn't one of us'? Relief when it was the other side? That reflex is the real problem — not any party, not any ideology. The reflex itself.

IX. FOR CHRISTIANS SPECIFICALLY
I was raised to lead a flock. I left the church, but not the lesson.

Matthew 25:35-40: 'I was a stranger and you welcomed me...' Jesus didn't add '...if they voted correctly.'

This week, documented in this report:
•	Federal agents physically attacked journalists
•	Dissent is being legally categorized as terrorism
•	Emergency healthcare protections have been rescinded
•	Elected officials are being called 'criminals who need to be jailed'

The question for Christians isn't political. It's: Are you more loyal to a political figure than to the teachings of Christ?
Which side of Matthew 25 are you on?

X. WHAT YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW
This is not hopeless. But it requires action.

Immediate Actions

1.	Verify everything yourself. Don't trust me. Check the sources cited. Read NSPM-7. Look up the court cases. Verify the legal citations.

2.	Document what you see. Screenshot everything. Archive links at archive.org. Save dates and timestamps. Create your own records.

3.	Contact your representatives. Call, don't just email. Be specific: 'I'm calling about NSPM-7' or 'the firing of 17 IGs.' Demand hearings. Don't accept form responses.

4.	Support accountability organizations: ACLU (fighting in courts), Reporters Without Borders (defending press), Brennan Center for Justice (voting rights litigation), Campaign Legal Center (elections accountability).

5.	Learn and teach Spiral Logic. Master documentation-based debate. Teach others. Use it on bad-faith actors. Create accountability through evidence, not outrage.

6.	Share strategically. Not just to people who agree. Focus on the persuadable middle. Use their own sources when possible. Let contradictions speak for themselves.

7.	Build local networks. Find like-minded people in your community. Organize for local elections. Create mutual aid systems.

8.	Maintain your humanity. The person with the yard sign you hate is scared too. Dehumanization is how we got here.

XI. THE CHOICE BEFORE US

Scenario A: This Succeeds
•	Opposition leaders arrested as 'terrorists'
•	Press silenced through violence and license threats
•	Courts ignored or packed
•	Military deployed against civilians as a matter of course
•	Democracy becomes performance art

Scenario B: This Fails
•	Legal accountability for each documented violation
•	Constitutional reforms to prevent recurrence
•	Restored faith in democratic institutions
•	Documented lessons for future generations

Which scenario happens depends on what we do now.
Not what we feel. Not what we post. What we do.

XII. A MESSAGE TO THOSE WHO STILL SUPPORT THIS
I understand why you voted for Trump. I understand your economic anxieties and your frustrations with a system that failed you.

But ask yourself honestly: Is this what you wanted?
•	Criminalizing dissent through NSPM-7
•	Federal agents attacking journalists
•	Deploying military against American citizens
•	Defying the Supreme Court
•	Targeting elected state leaders for arrest
•	Passing a law that blocks 21 million Americans from voting — including millions of your own voters

Because that is what you are getting. Not lower taxes. Not secure borders. Not economic prosperity. Authoritarianism.

And once you hand someone this much power, you don't get to decide how they use it. Today it's 'the left.' Tomorrow it could be you — when you're not 'pure' enough, when you question the wrong thing, when you become inconvenient.

XIII. THE HISTORICAL RECORD
Fifty years from now, people will ask: 'How did it happen? Did anyone try to stop it? Was it documented?'

The answers:
•	How: Documented above, in detail, with dates, laws, and citations.
•	Try to stop it: Yes. Courts, journalists, civil liberties organizations, and thousands of individuals documenting and resisting in real time.
•	See it coming: Yes. In real time.
•	Documented: Extensively. With legal citations, source links, timestamps, and pattern analysis.

No one can say they didn't know.

XIV. FINAL WORDS
I'm holding my father's Bible as I write this. His birthday is coming up soon.

I haven't been to church in years. But I never lost the lesson: You are what you feed on.

Right now, this nation is feeding on poison: rage-driven media, tribal identification, dehumanization of neighbors, weaponized violence, forgotten principles.

We're consuming ourselves and wondering why everything tastes like death.

The Constitution is not metaphorically burning. It is literally under attack:
•	Press freedom: Under physical attack
•	Separation of powers: Openly defied
•	Checks and balances: Systematically dismantled
•	Bill of Rights: Being rewritten as terrorism indicators
•	Voting rights: Being re-enclosed behind a financial barrier — a new kind of poll tax

This is not normal. This is not 'both sides.' This is a documented constitutional crisis with a clear pattern and intent.

XV. THE ONLY QUESTION THAT MATTERS
What will you do?

•	Dismiss this because it criticizes your side?
•	Share it to prove the other side is worse?
•	Feel nothing and scroll past?

Or will you:
•	Verify the sources yourself?
•	Contact your representatives?
•	Document what you see?
•	Teach others to think critically?
•	Remember your principles?
•	Choose to be human instead of tribal?

THE NATION YOU SAVE MIGHT BE YOUR OWN
53% of Project 2025 implemented in 13 months. 10 documented impeachable offenses. NSPM-7 criminalizing dissent. Military deployment against Americans. Press under physical attack. 21.3 million Americans at risk of disenfranchisement. This is not a drill. This is documented reality.

Documentation. Truth. Accountability. Humanity.
These are not partisan values. These are American values.
Defend them.
